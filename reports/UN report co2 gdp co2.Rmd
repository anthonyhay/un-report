This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a countryâ€™s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP.
